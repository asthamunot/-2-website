   1 billion children go to school every school day. But is that enough? <br> 

  Many more of those 1 billion children are enrolled in school. Yet, for many of them schooling does not mean learning. <br>
  The reason behind this is, A lack of trained teachers, insufficient learning materials, classes with limited facilities<br>
  and these make learning very difficult for many children. And many children also come to school very tired, exausted, sleepy, <br>
 and sick, and this really makes the expirience of learning very hard. <br> 
  The consequences of this are grave, an estimated 617 million children and adolescents <br> around the world are enable to reach minimum <br> 
  proficiency levels in reading and mathematics, even though two thirds of them are in school. <br>
  As a result, without education they may not be able to move ahead in their carreers, and will face many barriers just to earn <br>
  minimum wages. This will also be a great down fall for their communities, because they won't be able to take part in important decisions, <br>
  threatening their ability to build a better future for themselves and their communities. <br>

All children have the right to learn no matter, where they are from, their family status, their class, and and their financial satatus. <br> 
After all they are human. <br>
  
</p>

<p>
  Good education means, good, educated teachers that are motivated to teach, A friendly enviorment where kids are motivated to learn,  <br>
  and instruction that all kids can understand and make it easy for them to learn. This also requires that the learning is monitered and <br>
  the outcomes of the learning is measured. <br>
</p>

<p>
  In 144 countries around the world, UNICEF works to provide learning opportunities that prepare children and adolescents <br>
  with the knowledge and skills they need to thrive. 
  <br>
</p>
<h1>This is UNICEF's plan for success for the children</h1>
